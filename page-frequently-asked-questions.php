To learn more about these features of our software, please click <a href="/features">here</a>.</div>

<div id="question46" class="_category_question">Why does your software compare my performance against others?</div>

			<div class="_category_answer">Our preparation software seeks to compare customer performance against their cohort, i.e. other pilot candidates who have engaged with our software and whom may be competing directly with the customer, as this is representative of a method of assessment known as <b>Norm-Referenced Testing</b>.</br></br>

It is this method of assessment which is typically employed within computerised pilot aptitude testing to gauge the relative performance of an individual and make assumptions about their aptitude.</br></br>

Therefore, our software seeks to compare customer performance against others with the aim of providing greater context to the customer regarding their performance, much in the same way an administrator of a computerised pilot aptitude test would.</div>

<div id="question47" class="_category_question">Does your software tell me how much I've improved?</div>

			<div class="_category_answer">Yes, our preparation software provides considerable detail on your improvement.</br></br>

Feedback regarding your improvement is symbolised using a coloured <b>Improvement Rate Indicator</b>, displayed within the <b>Strength & Weakness Map</b>, an available option which may be selected when interpreting <b>Day-by-Day</b> performance and displayed within bar graphs throughout the software.</br></br>

To learn more about this feature of our software, please click <a href="/features">here</a>.</div>

<div id="question48" class="_category_question">Can I set targets to achieve or goals to reach?</div>

			<div class="_category_answer">Yes, you may set <b>Targets</b> to achieve, or you may use the <b>CoPilot Wizard</b> to establish realistic targets for you to achieve.</br></br>

To learn more about this feature of our software, please click <a href="/features">here</a>.</div>

<div id="question49" class="_category_question">How does predictive scoring work?</div>

<div class="_category_answer">Our preparation software uses <b>Mathematical Regression</b> to anticipate the future score of a customer, which will be achieved after a period of 14 days, if engagement with our software is maintained.</br></br>
